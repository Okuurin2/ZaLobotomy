## Features
 
### Existing Features
- Performance: View your statistics and match history as well as many other small things.
- Leaderboard: View your friends-only leaderboard to compare you and your friends.
- Contract: Complete your contract requirements by completing a quiz when needed.
- (DEV): Add/remove users from the restdb.io database

### Features Left to Implement
- Search Feature - Search any users on the database
- View matches - View specific match details in the match history

## Technologies Used

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.
- 

## Testing

There is two JS files for the leaderboard, one fetches data from RestDB
The other file is for if the API is down, so I used data stored on the JS file (basically hard coding)  

Note due to the RestDB having somewhat slow times, selecting filters will take a while.
